# Autonomocity (DeltaHacks VI)

Autonomocity is our project for DeltaHacks VI specifically tackling the Innovation Factory Challenge.

The inspiration for the project arose from identifying the major issues underlying current autonomous vehicle technology out on the market at the moment

Our proposed solutions included:

    Dynamic speed limits
    Patches of ice and snow protocols
    Left turn oncoming traffic indicator
    Blind turn vehicle detection
    Black Ice detection software
